## My process 

I worked on the background after setting up mobile. Finilized the project adjusting for desktop sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

Definetely got stuck with the background images. I found multiple ways to approach a solution but none seemed to perfectly add up. The background chosen works with set screen sizes, just doesn't look pretty when the screen is being manipulated.
